%This foreword feature needs some figuring out to allow user markup AND justified text, so it won't make it into LEQ just yet.

"To showcase LEQ, all possible headers are on display.

This - as yet - experimental foreword section is currently not part of LEQ yet, because allowing markup in here is a strong desire, but it would seem I would have to give up it's justified styling to do so. I'm sure I will eventually figure out a way around this.
This section could also be used as a short scene (state) summary, as sometimes found in musical scores.
