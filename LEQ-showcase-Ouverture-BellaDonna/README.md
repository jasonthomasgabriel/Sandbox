# Ouverture - Bella/Donna (LEQ Showcase)

 A reduction score from a composition for a family musical theatre show cowritten by me - as showcase for the Lilypond Engraving Quickstart repository (see below).

 You can find the [sheet music]([<link>](https://github.com/jasonthomasgabriel/Sandbox/blob/main/LEQ-showcase-Ouverture-BellaDonna/Ouverture-BellaDonna/ouverture.pdf)) in the folder `Ouverture-BellaDonna` as well as the LilyPond code used to engrave this. For this score I made use of my latest project: [LilyPond Engraving Quickstart](https://github.com/jasonthomasgabriel/LilyPond-Engraving-Quickstart). To find out more, head over to its [repository.](https://github.com/jasonthomasgabriel/LilyPond-Engraving-Quickstart)

> **Note:** For those wanting to run the LilyPond code, this project makes use of non-standard fonts. You will need to either instal them or comment out the include-file that calls for them. Should you want to instal them, they can be found in the folder `resources`.
